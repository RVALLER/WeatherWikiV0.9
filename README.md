# WeatherWikiV0.9

- Designed a full working weather terminology search catalogue with a pre-build dictionary of keys and definitions (constantly being expanded upon)
- Uses text-match package to best match user search criteria with a working term in the dictionary
- Added simplistic, small-scale UI for easier usability and smoother experience

Future Goals:
- Add a light mode / dark mode toggle [x]
- Allow user suggestions for term submission [ ]
- Convert to Web hosted (?) { ]
- Fix text alignments [ ]
- QoL [ ]
