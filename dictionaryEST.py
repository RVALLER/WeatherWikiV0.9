    "bowEcho": "A bow echo is a curved or bowed radar signature of a line of thunderstorms that can indicate severe "
               "weather. This is often indicated by the 'bow' like appearance shown on radars.",

    "superCell": "an agglomeration of several thunderstorm cells which have aggregated to one big system."
                 "stronger winds, hail, and chance for tornadic activity is increased in these storms.",

    "merger": "a process in which two or more convective cells or storms merge into a larger storm, then share a common"
              " cloud material and dynamical circulation, which is critical for the development, maintenance, and "
              "reinforcement of some intense weather systems like thunderstorms, hailstorms",

    "convectionCurrent": "the vertical movement of air caused by the rising of warm air and the sinking of cool air,"
                         " which plays a key role in creating weather patterns like clouds, winds, and thunderstorms",

    "rearFlankDowndrafts": "a region of dry air that descends and wraps around the back of a mesocyclone in a supercell"
                           " thunderstorm. RFDs are thought to be a key factor in the formation of tornadoes.",

    "mesocyclone": "A storm-scale region of rotation, typically around 2-6 miles in diameter and often found in the "
                   "right rear flank of a supercell",

    "vortex": "A vortex is the rotating column of air and water that circulates around the central part of a tornado "
              "and intensifies as it descends",

    "corepunch": "A core punch is a slang term for when a vehicle drives into the heavy precipitation core of "
                 "a thunderstorm",

    "intercept": " refers to the act of directly encountering a weather phenomenon, most commonly used in the context "
                 "of storm chasing where a person or team actively moves towards a developing storm to observe it "
                 "closely, like driving into the path of a tornado to study its behavior",

    "squallLine": "A squall line is a line of thunderstorms that can produce heavy rain, high winds, lightning, hail, "
                  "waterspouts, and sometimes tornadoes. Squall lines can be hundreds of miles long but are "
                  "usually only 10â€“20 miles wide",

    "Derecho": "is a widespread, long-lived, straight-line wind storm that is associated with a fast-moving group of "
               "severe thunderstorms known as a mesoscale convective system. Derechos cause hurricane-force winds, "
               "heavy rains, and flash floods. A derecho comes from a long-lived bow echo or a series of bow echoes",

    "Straight-Line Winds": "Straight line winds are thunderstorm winds that have no rotation, i.e. not a tornado",

    "Downburst": " powerful winds that descend from a thunderstorm and spread out quickly once they hit the ground."
                 " These winds can easily cause wind damage similar to that of a EF0 or in rare cases, EF1 Tornado's",

    "Blizzard": " a blizzard is a weather event that includes low temperatures, wind speeds greater than 56 kilometers "
                "(35 miles) per hour, and a large amount of falling or blowing snow that lowers visibility to 0.4 "
                "kilometers (0.25 mile) for a minimum of three hours",

    "ThunderSnow": "Thundersnow, also known as a winter thunderstorm or a thundersnow storm, is a thunderstorm in which"
                   "snow falls as the primary precipitation instead of rain. Its rarity is primarily due to the "
                   "meteorological conditions of winter, and is only observed ~6.5 times a year. ",

    "FlashFLood": "A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 "
                  "hours."
                  " Flash floods are usually characterized by raging torrents after heavy rains that rip through river "
                  "beds, urban streets, or mountain canyons sweeping everything before them",
